# quantumblack-hackathon

QuantumBlack x Life Sciences Hackathon, run by QB/McKinsey

Language types: Python, SQL

Led a team of 4 in developing a predictive model for detecting rare disease (PNH) diagnosis on a database of 1M patients between 2017-2022. Included the following tasks:

* Translated medical research into 600+ dataframe features; used Regex to translate medical diagnosis and procedures codes into binary flags and frequency counts
* Used PySpark to stitch together multiple databases (procedures, diagnoses, patients, medical providers, pharmacy data, etc.) into usable timeseries dataframe
* Built model pipeline for training RandomForest and XGBoost classifiers using walk-forward validation
* Assisted with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning
